width of cube : 55mm
diagonal width of cube: ~77.7817 w = (sqrt(55^2 * 2))
55 - w =~ 11.3908 ((w-55)/2)

'A' corner vertex (when viewed from the top) moves along a unit circle with a diameter of the diagonal width of the cube
Where is it's home position cordinates?:
x = 55/2
y = 55/2
t = 45`
y = w*sin(theta)
x = w*cos(theta)
