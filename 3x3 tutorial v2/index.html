<!-- GENERAL TODO
Make the text size overall smaller so more content fits on screen 
    Take a poll from people if I should actually do this /\
Move the images so they are to the right of the paragraphs instead of below them 
    In progress. Almost done
Move the 'How to solve a Rubik's cube' to the header by the Logo and move the nav below both of them
Change the nav so it highlights which page the user is on
Fix the logo size and spacing
    Done for index page, notation, and beginner tips. Need for the other pages
Change the colors on the page to be lighter and more modern looking
    Done
Make the borders on page more interesting. They look too flat right now.
    Done?
Add a page nav to the main page so they can jump to a specific step if all of the colapsable sections are open
    Done
Make the sections of the main tutorial colapsable so the page isn't so long to scroll through
    Done
Notation reminder:
    Fix the styling here so it is layed out to be more readable
    Add reminder text for what " ' " and " 2 " mean
Add animated images?
    Too complicated
Add images and paragraphs at the beginning of each section to show what the goal is for the section
Change the algorithm styling. It looks odd with the new style
Update the intermediate and advance pages. Possibly just add links to other tutorials and sources for algs and tips instead of writing them out
Compress images so they are smaller to reduce load times
Fix the icon so it doesn't flicker when changing pages (could just be a live-server thing)
Add meta tags to the other pages
Add aria-labels where needed
Update the phrasing on a lot of the paragraphs. Dont use 'I', 'me', 'my', etc.

                        isn't in the correct spot. In the second picture you can see both colors match.</p>

                    <p>Here is one method of inserting the cross pieces into the right spot. The first step is to get
                        the
                        cross
                        piece into the yellow layer with the white sticker facing upwards. (Being in the yellow layer
                        means
                        it
                        is right next to the yellow center. See the picture below for an example)</p>

                    <img src="images/F2_cross_1.png" alt="cross insert image 2">
                    <p>Once our cross piece is in the yellow layer we can turn the yellow face until the other color on
                        our
                        edge
                        piece matches the center piece below it.</p>

                    <img src="images/F2_cross_2.png" alt="cross insert image 3">
                    <p>Then we can turn the front of our cube 180 degrees to put it into the white layer.</p>
                </div>

                <p>This is the best way to put edge pieces in. Using the U face you can align the cross piece with
                    its other color and then turn the front face to insert the cross piece.</p>
                <!-- Fix this so it doesn't use the term 'u face' -->

                <p class="note">Note: In all of the the images in this tutorial the side to the left will be the
                    side that is facing us. In this case the red side is facing us.</p>

                    <p>This is one of the other possible cases to get. As you can see in the image below, the white
                        sticker
                        isn't facing up. This means we will have to do something slightly different.

                    <p>First we will move the edge piece to the side like this:</p>

                    <img src="images/fliped_cross_piece_3.png" alt="flipped cross piece image 3">
                    <p>Then we will move the right side down so the edge sticker matches the center color. In this case
                        the sticker and center color is red.</p>

                    <p>Then we put the cross piece into its solved spot like this:</p>

                    <img src="images/fliped_cross_piece_5.png" alt="flipped cross piece image 5">
                    <p>Because we did that then the other cross piece nearby got moved. In this case the other cross
                        piece was the green one so we need to fix it like this:</p>
                </div>

                <p>Now that we have done that then we should have our red piece in place!</p>

                    <p>Another possible thing that can happen while solving the cross pieces is this. The piece can be
                        in a weird spot and moving it will break another one of our cross pieces. This is one way we can
                        deal with that.</p>

                    <p>First we will lift the piece up using the right side like this:</p>
                </div>

                    <img src="images/f2l_cross_piece_3.png" alt="f2l cross piece 3">
                    <p>Then we will move it out of the way like this:</p>

                    <p>Then we will fix the cross piece that we broke during the first move like this:</p>
                </div>

                <p>As you can see we put the cross piece into the yellow layer and now we can solve it using one of
                    the previous methods mentioned.</p>

                    <p>Our next step is to finish our first layer by putting in the corners. Much like the cross pieces
                        the edge color does matter. Here's an example of one solved incorrectly.</p>

                    <p>As you can see in the first picture the corner is in the wrong spot. The edge colors
                        don't match the
                        cross pieces around it. This corner is correct though because the edge colors match
                        the cross pieces around it.</p>

                    <p>Here's a couple of ways to put in the corners. The first is pretty simple and also the most
                        common
                        and it
                        looks like this.</p>
                </div>

                <p>The first thing to notice about this is that the white sticker on the corner is facing sideways. This
                    is
                    what we want. If the sticker is facing upwards (meaning the white sticker is facing the same
                    direction
                    as the yellow center) then it is a little bit different and will be explained later in this step.

                    <p>The first step we should do is to put the corner in the yellow layer and put it on top of where
                        it
                        belongs when it is solved. That looks something like this:</p>

                    <p>Now that the piece is on top of where it belongs then we are going to rotate the whole cube so

                        white
                        sticker should be facing us. Once we have done that then we need to see which side of the front
                        face
                        our
                        corner is on. In this case the corner is on the right side of our front face. Becase it is on
                        the
                        right
                        side then we are going to move it to the left first like this:</p>

                        we are going to lift up the right face like this:</p>

                    pair back that we hid.</p>

                <p>To do this case just do the algorithm once and it will give you one of cases we talked about
